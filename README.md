## Climate Change Modelling 





## Description

A reproducible Jupyter notebook project that ingests historical climate data (temperature, precipitation, CO₂, sea level, etc.), performs exploratory data analysis, builds forecasting and regression models, and produces scenario-based projections and visualization-ready outputs. Useful for researchers, students, or policy analysts who want hands-on examples of time-series forecasting, model comparison, and uncertainty-aware scenario exploration.


## Project Highlights

1.Goal: Forecast climate variables and explore future scenarios using classical time-series and machine-learning approaches.
2.Notebook: Climate_change_modelling.ipynb — end-to-end workflow (data → EDA → modeling → evaluation → scenarios).
3.Methods: ARIMA/SARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, RandomForest/GBM/XGBoost regressors, optional LSTM experiments.
4.Outputs: Forecast CSVs, model artifacts, and publication-quality plots with confidence/uncertainty bands.
5.Use cases: temperature/precipitation forecasting, policy scenario analysis, educational demonstration.

## Environment & Key Dependencies

Python: 3.8+ recommended

Core libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels


## How to Run

Put your climate data files into data/raw/ or update the notebook data paths.
Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook Climate_change_modelling.ipynb
Run cells top-to-bottom. 

Sections are modular (Data → EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation → Forecasting → Visualizations).


## Notebook Walkthrough 

1.Data ingestion & inspection — load CSV/NetCDF, check units, datetimes, missingness.

2.Cleaning & resampling — fill/flag missing values, resample to monthly/annual as required.

3.EDA — time-series plots, decomposition (trend/seasonality), autocorrelation, cross-correlation, heatmaps.

4.Feature engineering — lags, rolling stats, seasonal indicators, exogenous regressors (CO₂, ENSO, indices).

5.Modeling

Baseline persistence model
ML regressors (RandomForest / XGBoost) for multivariate forecasting
Optional LSTM experiments for sequence learning

6. Evaluation — MAE, RMSE, MAPE, residual diagnostics, cross-validation via time-series splits.

7. Forecasting & Scenarios — produce forecasts under different exogenous assumptions; save outputs to outputs/.

8.Visualization — prediction plots with confidence intervals, seasonal plots, heatmaps, and comparative model charts.


## Final Note

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.  
This project is a small step towards using data and machine learning for a sustainable future.
